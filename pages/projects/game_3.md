## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Project Initiation and Team Assembly

- **Description**: One of the initial challenges we encountered was getting the project off the ground and assembling the right team for its development. Finding skilled and dedicated team members who shared our vision proved to be a critical hurdle.
  
- **How it was overcome**: 
  
  We overcame this challenge through persistence and collaborative efforts. By networking within the game development community, we eventually identified individuals whose expertise aligned with our project's needs. This marked the turning point, and as our team came together, the development of the game gained significant momentum.

### Challenge 2: Parallax Implementation

- **Description**: 
  
  Implementing the parallax scrolling effect, which is crucial for creating the game's visually appealing backgrounds, presented its own set of challenges. Ensuring that it not only looked good but also functioned seamlessly was a complex task.

- **How it was overcome**: 
  
  Overcoming this challenge required a combination of perseverance and teamwork. Our development team diligently fine-tuned the parallax code to achieve the desired effect. We iteratively tested and adjusted the background scrolling speed and layering to ensure that it complemented the gameplay and visuals effectively. The end result was a parallax system that not only looked impressive but also enhanced the overall gaming experience.

- **How it was overcome**: 
  
  To tackle this challenge, our development team implemented a step-by-step approach. We first established a clear flowchart of how the Ability System would function. Then, we meticulously designed and structured the classes involved, ensuring they could communicate seamlessly. Thorough testing and debugging played a pivotal role in refining the system until it operated smoothly. The result was an intuitive and engaging Ability System that added depth to the gameplay.

### Challenge 4: Object and Collectible Spawning in Parallax Environment

- **Description**: 
  
  Another significant challenge we faced was ensuring that objects and collectibles spawned correctly within the parallax environment. This meant preventing them from overlapping or lagging behind as the parallax scrolling speed increased.

- **How it was overcome**: 
  
  To address this challenge, our development team put considerable effort into optimizing the object and collectible spawning logic. We adjusted spawn rates and positions based on the parallax scrolling speed, ensuring that objects appeared at the right time and in alignment with the player's progression. Extensive testing and adjustments were made to ensure a seamless experience, where objects and collectibles synchronized harmoniously with the parallax background.
