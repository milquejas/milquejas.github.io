# Heidi's Quest: Mansion of Shadows

### Target Audience & Platform  

Genre: 2D Side-scrolling Horror 

Target Audience: Age 18+ 

Platform: Mobile, PC 

Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between misty hills, lived a courageous 10-year-old girl named Heidi. She had fiery red hair that matched her determination and a heart full of love for her family. Heidi had recently discovered that her beloved little brother, Timmy, had been captured by a terrible monster that haunted the surrounding forest.

Braving the darkness that had settled over the land, Heidi made a bold decision. She couldn't bear the thought of her brother suffering in the clutches of that dreaded creature any longer. With a deep breath and unwavering resolve, she embarked on a perilous journey to rescue Timmy from the clutches of the beast.

The monster's lair was a mansion that loomed ominously at the edge of the forest, its eerie silhouette against the moonlit sky sending shivers down the spines of even the bravest souls in the village. Rumors whispered of the mansion's dark secrets, and everyone knew to stay far away from it. But Heidi was not deterred by fear; her love for her brother was her guiding light.

As she ventured into the mansion, a chilling silence enveloped her. The only source of light in the deep heart of the castle was the faint glow of little matches that Heidi and Timmy had managed to leave behind while being dragged to the attic. Each matchstick represented a moment of hope, a silent cry for help.
